	<p>Earlier this week, TGA brought in <a href="https://github.com/bethjohnson">Beth Johnson</a> to talk to us more in-depth about time complexity. She presented us with clear methods for determining time complexity of various algorithms. I found this information to be very helpful, so hopefully others will also. The exercises Beth went through with us can be found in <a href="https://github.com/bethjohnson/algo-time-complexity-review">this repo</a>.</p>
	<p>In summary, to find the time complexity of any algorithm,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Look at each line and determine what the number of operations is, in terms of n. Each line will have a time complexity that is constant, n, 2n, n<sup>2</sup>, etc.</li>
		<li>Look at the overall algorithm. ADD lines that are in series and MULTIPLY lines that are nested in other function calls or loops.</li>
		<li>Drop the coefficients (e.g., 4n<sup>2</sup> becomes n<sup>2</sup>). You're left with the time complexity of the algorithm, which is written as O(n<sup>2</sup>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big-O notation</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Here are the types of time complexities that we are likely to encounter, along with examples to illustrate them. They are listed in order of best to worst time complexity. However, it should be noted that with smaller input sizes, it would be more efficient to use an algorithm with a "higher" time complexity. See a graph of that condition <a href="http://science.slc.edu/~jmarshall/courses/2002/spring/cs50/BigO/">here</a>.</p>
