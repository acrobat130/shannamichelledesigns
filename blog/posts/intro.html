	<p>Today I am wrapping up my second week as a student at <a href="http://www.telegraphacademy.com/">Telegraph Academy</a>. Telegraph Academy (TGA) is a bootcamp-style programming school that caters to people of color and people who are underrepresented in the tech industry. TGA opened earlier this year in partnership with <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, and I am in the second cohort of students - TGA[1]. I recently made the tough decision to quit my job and put my life on hold to learn how to program for 11+ hours each day. Everyone said it would be difficult, and boy were they right.</p>
	<p>Before classes even started, we had several weeks worth of precourse work to complete. Keep in mind that at this point, every student had already passed a technical interview to demonstrate their JavaScript understanding. The precourse work was riddled with new concepts and challenging javascript prompts. During this time, we had our first introduction to libraries (e.g., <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>) and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">Recursion</a> (more on that later).</p>
	<p>Then classes started, and there has been a whirlwind of information flying at us ever since. Remember that game you used to play at birthday parties at the roller rink, where someone goes into a telephone booth-looking contraption, and tries to grab as many flying $1 bills as they can? It seems so simple when you're wathcing someone else do it. Then you give it a try, realize you're in way over your head, and you struggle to catch ANY of the $1 bills. Programming bootcamp is pretty much like that, but in the best possible way.</p>
	<p>In the past two weeks, we have covered a plethora of information at lightning speed. We have had practice with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">Closures</a></li>
		<li>Instantiation patterns</li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">Prototype chains</a></li>
		<li>Data structures</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">Algorithms</a></li>
		<li>Subclassing patterns</li>
		<li>The <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3 library</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We completed a new project for each of these topics, receiving a new project every two days. Talk about exhausting. However, this learning style really suits me - we are constantly throwing ourselves into challenging situations and figuring it out along the way. The past two days were perhaps the most intimidating, after being tasked with building a game that is based on the <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3 library</a>, starting from a blank javascript file. As overwhelming as that project was initially, my partner and I were able to break it down, struggle through it, and figure most of it out.</p>
	<p>As I progress through this course, I will post updates here regarding specific javascript and programming topics. Of course, some non-programming topics might sneak their way in...</p>
